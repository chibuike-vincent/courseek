### Problem

Developers most times find that they spend so much time looking for a befitting courseware or tutorial that teaches them exactly what they need to know. From personal experience, it's observable that you could have more than is required and therefore breed confusion and overloading of one's learning progres.

### Proposed Solution

Time is of essence, so we seek to reduce the search time, by collating relevant courses from top online platforms and delivered to the user upon login or search. All the user has to do is sort, filter or jump straight to learning the course of choice.

Keeping track of progress is also a desired feature as well as offline study, so that users can continue studying even if they happen to go offline.

### Proposed Stack

- __FrontEnd__: HTML, CSS | Bootstrap | Sass
- __Backend__: NodeJs & Express
- __Database__: MongoDb & Mongoose
